This assignment was testing the testing following learning objectives:

## Key Learning Objectives

- Connect our Spring application to PostgreSQL and manage our data with Spring Repositories
- Explore how Repositories help and simplify our iterations with the database by giving us methods to manage data
- Learn how to create seeders in Spring with the help of our repositories and CommandLineRunner
- Create a `@RestController` instance
- Create API GET and POST endpoints
- Retrieve data from the DB and pass it to the front end via an API endpoint as an Object
- Understand pagination and why we might use it
- Create a custom exception for our REST Controllers
- Understand how to pass validations to the front-end using BindingResult and ResponseEntity
- Understand the arguments for using serialization
- Clarify the set up of DTOs, and services to facilitate serialization

## Guiding Conceptual Questions

- What is a repository and what does it do for us?
- How can we use a repository to get a list of data from a database table?
- What repository method could we use to get data by id?
- Why do we need a RestController?
- How does a RestController differ from our normal controllers
- How would you set up pagination in an application?
- How do you set up a thymeleaf form to display input errors?
- What is the difference between a DTO and Service?
- Where would you use a MapStruct mapper?
